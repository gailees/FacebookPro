To load into Chrome:

1. Visit chrome://extensions/
2. Check the "Developer mode" box at the top
3. Click "Load unpacked extension..."
4. Select the "Facebook Pro" folder

Every time you edit code, you'll need to return to chrome://extensions/ and select the "Reload"
option next to Facebook Pro.

Before you get started, you'll need to copy config-sample.json to config.json. You'll also need to
create a Firebase account, create a new app, and then put the app's URL in config.json.
